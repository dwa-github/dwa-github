### Hi, I'm Abdurrahim 👋

I'm a versatile IT Professional with a passion for both **Full-Stack Development** and **Application Management**. My goal is to act as the bridge between technology and the end-user, creating solutions that are not only technically sound but also intuitive and user-friendly.

- 🔭 I’m currently building modern web applications using **React, Next.js, and TypeScript**.
- 🌱 My unique background in **IT Support, Service Coordination (ITIL & SLA), and Application Management** gives me a deep understanding of the entire service lifecycle, from user needs to final deployment.
- 👯 I enjoy translating complex requirements into clean, scalable, and maintainable code.
